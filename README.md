**Super old tool (2022) that originally was oriented on swatting purposes. The code is bad asf and I'm not going to rewrite it.**  
How it works?
- The tool goes to your link that you specified
- It finds all email addresses on this page
- It goes to another "a" element with hrefs (pages) and also searching for addresses there
- Adding all the email addresses to mail_list
- Then you will be asked for sending your certain messages to all of these addresses via Gmail (with your login credentials, of course)
