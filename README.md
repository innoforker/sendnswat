**Super old tool (2022) that originally was oriented on swatting purposes. The code is bad asf and I'm not going to rewrite it.**  
How it works?
- Tool goes to your link that you specified
- It finds all emails on this page
- It goes to another "a" with hrefs (pages) and also searching for emails there
- Adding all the emails to mail_list
- Then you will be asked for sending your certain messages to all of these emails on Gmail (with your login credentials, of course)
